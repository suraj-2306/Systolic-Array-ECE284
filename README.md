# ECE284
Repository for the final ECE 284 Fa23 project

# Ideas for Alpha
1. SFU - Filtered accumulation
2. Power gating for the mac unit
3. Approximate operators fro mac unit

# Tasks for Tomorrow
1. Memory pointer from the file to sram
2. Reading the required bits to the L0
  2.1 Reading weights as per kij's
  2.2 Reading activation according to the required and used bits 
3. Logic for W and C enable 
4. State Machine to iterate kij's
5. Ofifo and SFU part to 
  5.1 Understand how ofifo accepts and sends data after the 9 cycles
  5.2 How does the SFU accumulate the required data from the ofifo
6. Store the data back to the memory and validate it
